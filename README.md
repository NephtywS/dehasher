# Known issue

- 1.0
  - CUI Support is complete, but not being applied because of PyInstaller's --noconsole option.<br> with --noconsole option, program results won't show in the command line.<br>I've working on it, but it is so hard for me.
  - Program size is too big since UPX does not support Mac (64bit) and Linux (64bit) platform, It is difficult to solve.
